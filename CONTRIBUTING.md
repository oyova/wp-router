## Coding Standards
This project uses [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) to automatically fix PHP coding standards issues. The official [WordPress CodeSniffer Rules Project](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards) serves as the basis of setup and configuration. The specific rules for this project are configured in the `phpcs.xml` file. Run the command `phpcs` to detect violations or `phpcbf` to automatically correct coding standards violations. A specific file or directory may be passed as the first argument for either command; otherwise, the files & directories configured in `phpcs.xml` will be used.
